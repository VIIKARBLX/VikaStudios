        <h2>Work and Community:</h2>
        Hello! I'm VikaDev, the owner of Vika Studios! Vika Studios is a small Community that is growing slowly. We are currently working on a game named Insane Tappers. We are looking for experienced developers that can build low poly style and we need gui designers that can make simulator styled gui's. We are also looking for gfx designers, that can make game icons, thumbnails, gamepass icons and badge icons. If you are interested of working for us, join our discord server (Watch our social links) or dm me on twitter (VikaDevRBLX).
